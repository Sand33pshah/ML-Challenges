# ML Challenges

This repository contains a collection of machine learning challenges, each designed to help you practice and master key concepts in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation. The focus is on practical, hands-on learning using real datasets and step-by-step analysis.

## What You Can Learn

- **Data Preparation:** How to clean, preprocess, and explore raw data before modeling.
- **Feature Engineering:** Techniques to extract and create informative features.
- **Model Development:** Building, training, and evaluating various machine learning models.
- **Practical Problem Solving:** Applying ML to real-world challenges and interpreting results.
- **Code-First Approach:** End-to-end workflows using Python and popular ML libraries.

## Repository Structure

- **Datasets:**  
  Real-world CSV datasets used for each challenge.

- **Challenge Notebooks/Scripts:**  
  Well-documented Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts for each challenge, covering:
  - Data loading and inspection
  - Handling missing values
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Feature engineering and selection
  - Model training, testing, and evaluation metrics

## Example Workflow

Below is a sample code snippet for loading a CSV file, inspecting the dataset, and checking for null values using Python and pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

# Display all rows
print(df)

# Count the number of null values in each column
print(df.isnull().sum())
```

## How to Use This Repo

1. **Pick a challenge:** Choose a dataset and its corresponding notebook/script.
2. **Follow the workflow:** Each file guides you through data loading, cleaning, EDA, modeling, and evaluation.
3. **Practice & extend:** Try modifying the code, experimenting with features or models, and drawing your own insights.
